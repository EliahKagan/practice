# LeetCode #226 - Invert Binary Tree

Although this problem is often named this way (it is *not* a quirk of LeetCode),
the name is misleading. Binary trees are often used to implement maps, for which
inversion has a specific meaning unrelated to this. Furthermore, to invert an
object is most often to turn it upside down, which also does not apply here.

This problem is to modify a binary tree to turn it into its mirror image. It can
be solved by traversing the tree in any order using any technique and swapping
the values of each node's left and right pointers.
