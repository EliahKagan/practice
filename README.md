# practice - current repository of my solutions to coding exercises/challenges

These are my solutions to coding and algorithms exercises (practice problems /
competitive programming problems) since mid-2020.

This repository is licensed under [0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html).
See [**`LICENSE`**](LICENSE).

Some material in this repository is not written by me; for example, problems
sometimes contain scaffolding code written by problem setters, and I&rsquo;ve
included some small input test cases. I&rsquo;ve only included any material not
written by me when I believe it is clearly fair use. See
[`LICENSE-NOTE.md`](LICENSE-NOTE.md) for details.

## Older Practice Solutions

My solutions from before then are not as well organized, but they are available
in
[old-practice-snapshot](https://github.com/EliahKagan/old-practice-snapshot).
See the README in that repository for more information (including on how I plan
to improve the organization of that file tree in the future).
