# practice - current repository of my solutions to coding exercises/challenges

These are my solutions to coding and algorithms exercises (practice problems /
competitive programming problems) since April 2020.

This repository is licensed under [0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html).
See [**`LICENSE`**](LICENSE).

Some material in this repository is not written by me; for example, problems
sometimes contain scaffolding code written by problem setters, and I&rsquo;ve
included some small input test cases. I&rsquo;ve only included any material not
written by me when I believe it is clearly fair use. See
[`FAIR-USE.md`](FAIR-USE.md) for details.

## Major directories

A few of the directories here have substantial code, corresponding to numerous
practice exercise solutions, while others have just a few.

The directories of greatest interest are currently `leetcode`, `hackerrank`,
and `advent-of-code`.

## Older practice solutions

My solutions from before then are not as well organized, but they are available
in
[old-practice-snapshot](https://github.com/EliahKagan/old-practice-snapshot).
See the README in that repository for more information (including on how I plan
to improve the organization of that file tree in the future).

That repository has way more of my GeeksforGeeks and HackerRank solutions than
here.
